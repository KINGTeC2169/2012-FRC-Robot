## 2012 Rebound Rumble

Sir Galahad, our 2012 Rebound Rumble robot, performed better than expected and brought us to the [2012 FRC World Championship Event](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/championship-event) held in St. Louis, MI. Although it was amazing in competition, programming our robot for the 2012 season was a challenge.

## Summary of Code
  - 2 joysticks for driving, 1 for shooting
  - Tank drive with shifting
  - PID Control for maintaining proper shooter speed
  - Two pneumatic kickers to push the bridges down and to keep our robot on its wheels
  - Servo controlled camera pan and tilt
  - Vision processing was attempted, but not used in our competition code
  - FRC Dashboard modifications, not included
